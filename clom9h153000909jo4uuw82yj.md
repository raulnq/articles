In production environments, collecting diagnostics such as traces, logs, metrics, and dumps can be challenging. Typically, one must access the environment, install some tools, and then gather the information. [dotnet-monitor](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/tree/main/documentation) simplifies and unifies the way of collecting diagnostic information by exposing a REST API, regardless of where your application is being executed (on your local machine, an on-premises server, or within a Kubernetes cluster). Depending on our needs, dotnet-monitor could serve as a replacement for other [.NET diagnostic tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/tools-overview), such as [dotnet-counters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-counters), [dotnet-dump](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-dump), [dotnet-gcdump](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-gcdump), and [dotnet-trace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-trace), particularly in the context of information collection.

## Setup

We can install `dotnet-monitor` as a global tool using the following command:

```powershell
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-monitor --version 8.0.0-rc.2.23502.11
```

Once installed, we can start `dotnet-monitor` via the following command:

```powershell
dotnet monitor collect --no-auth
```

`dotnet-monitor` includes the Swagger UI for exploring the API surface under `https://localhost:52323`. To test the tool, we will use a standard .NET application. Run the following commands:

```powershell
dotnet new web -o DotNetMonitorSandBox
dotnet new sln -n DotNetMonitorSandbox
dotnet sln add --in-root DotNetMonitorSandBox
```

## Processes

The [Processes API](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/blob/main/documentation/api/processes.md) lists the processes that `dotnet-monitor` can detect and obtain their metadata. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:52323/processes` to list the available processes (make sure you have run our sample application):

```json
[
  {
    "pid": 19828,
    "uid": "66140161-2208-4e7c-b874-79aa037d4344",
    "name": "dotnet",
    "isDefault": false
  },
  {
    "pid": 57388,
    "uid": "2b0aba55-1579-41a5-b6a7-c1575650352a",
    "name": "DotNetMonitorSandBox",
    "isDefault": false
  }
]
```

The `pid` property represents the ID of the process. The `uid` property is useful for uniquely identifying a process when it's running in an environment where the process ID may not be unique (for instance, multiple containers within a Kubernetes pod will have entry point processes with process ID 1). Navigate to `https://localhost:52323/process?pid={pid}` to see more information or `https://localhost:52323/env?pid={pid}` to get the environment variables of the specified process.

## Logs

The [Logs API](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/blob/main/documentation/api/logs.md) enables collecting logs that are logged to the [ILogger&lt;&gt; infrastructure](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging). Open the `Program.cs` file and update the content as follows:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGet("/", () =>
{
    app.Logger.LogInformation("Hello World!");
    return "Hello World!";
});

app.Run();
```

Run the application and navigate to `https://localhost:52323/logs?pid={pid}&durationSeconds=60` to stream (it may take some time to start) our log statements during the next 60 seconds.

## Traces

The [Traces API](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/blob/main/documentation/api/trace.md) enables collecting `.nettrace` formatted traces. To capture the traces of a process using a predefined set of trace profiles (`Cpu`, `Http`, `Logs`, `Metrics`)**,** navigate to `https://localhost:52323/trace?pid={pid}&durationSeconds=60` and wait to get the file. Open the `Program.cs` file and update the content as follows:

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics.Tracing;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGet("/", () =>
{
    app.Logger.LogInformation("Hello World!");
    MyEventSource.Log.Request("Hello World!");
    return "Hello World!";
});

app.Run();

[EventSource(Name = "MyEventSource")]
public sealed class MyEventSource : EventSource
{
    public static MyEventSource Log { get; } = new MyEventSource();

    [Event(1, Level = EventLevel.Informational)]
    public void Request(string message)
    {
        WriteEvent(1, message);
    }
}
```

To capture the traces of a custom event provider, we need to make a POST call to the same endpoint using the following request body:

```json
{
    "Providers": [{
        "Name": "MyEventSource",
        "EventLevel": "Informational"
    }],
    "BufferSizeInMB": 1024
}
```

On Windows, `.nettrace` files can be viewed in [PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview) for analysis or in Visual Studio:

## Metrics

The [Metrics API](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/blob/main/documentation/api/metrics.md) gets a snapshot of metrics in the [**Prometheus exposition format**](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#text-based-format) of a **single process** (the `pid` will be set through configuration). `dotnet-monitor` can read and combine configurations from multiple [sources](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/blob/main/documentation/configuration/configuration-sources.md). The file settings path for Windows is `%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet-monitor\settings.json`. So, let's update the file with the following content (or create it if it's not present):

```json
{
  "DefaultProcess": {
    "Filters": [{
      "Key": "ProcessId",
      "Value": "<pid>"
    }]
  },
}
```

The configuration will be automatically loaded by `dotnet-monitor`. The metrics collected are from the following providers by default:

* `System.Runtime`
    
* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting`
    
* `Grpc.AspNetCore.Server`
    

Navigate to `https://localhost:52323/metrics` to see an output similar to:

```json
# HELP systemruntime_cpu_usage_ratio CPU Usage
# TYPE systemruntime_cpu_usage_ratio gauge
systemruntime_cpu_usage_ratio 0 1699198374885
systemruntime_cpu_usage_ratio 0 1699198379898
systemruntime_cpu_usage_ratio 0 1699201002325
# HELP systemruntime_working_set_bytes Working Set
# TYPE systemruntime_working_set_bytes gauge
systemruntime_working_set_bytes 63393792 1699198364894
systemruntime_working_set_bytes 63401984 1699198369888
systemruntime_working_set_bytes 63418368 1699198374885
# HELP systemruntime_gc_heap_size_bytes GC Heap Size
# TYPE systemruntime_gc_heap_size_bytes gauge
systemruntime_gc_heap_size_bytes 7085504 1699198364894
systemruntime_gc_heap_size_bytes 7093696 1699198369888
systemruntime_gc_heap_size_bytes 7110080 1699198374885
```

`dotnet-monitor` works with both [System.Diagnostics.Metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/metrics-collection) (.NET 8 Apps) based APIs and [EventCounters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/event-counters) (you can see the difference between the metrics APIs [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/compare-metric-apis)). As we are using a .NET 7, we will modify the `Program.cs` file as follows:

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics.Tracing;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGet("/", () =>
{
    app.Logger.LogInformation("Hello World!");
    MyEventSource.Log.Request("Hello World!");
    return "Hello World!";
});

app.Run();

[EventSource(Name = "MyEventSource")]
public sealed class MyEventSource : EventSource
{
    public static MyEventSource Log { get; } = new MyEventSource();

    private EventCounter _counter;

    public MyEventSource()
    {
        _counter = new EventCounter("my-custom-counter", this)
        {
            DisplayName = "my-custom-counter",
            DisplayUnits = "ms"
        };
    }

    [Event(1, Level = EventLevel.Informational)]
    public void Request(string message)
    {
        WriteEvent(1, message);
        _counter.WriteMetric(1);
    }
}
```

To capture the metrics of a custom event provider, we need to modify the `settings.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "Metrics": {
    "Providers": [
      {
        "ProviderName": "MyEventSource",
        "CounterNames": [
          "my-custom-counter"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "DefaultProcess": {
    "Filters": [{
      "Key": "ProcessId",
      "Value": "<pid>"
    }]
  },
}
```

## Live Metrics

The [Live Metrics API](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/blob/main/documentation/api/livemetrics.md) captures metrics for a chosen process (the same default providers listed in the metrics section). Navigate to `https://localhost:52323/livemetrics?pid={pid}&durationSeconds=60` and wait to get a `.json` file. To capture the live metrics of a custom event provider, we need to make a `POST` call to the same endpoint using the following request body:

```json
{
    "includeDefaultProviders": false,
    "providers": [
        {
            "providerName": "MyEventSource",
            "counterNames": [
                "my-custom-counter"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The output will resemble the following:

```json
{"timestamp":"2023-11-05T18:52:32.5333078-05:00","provider":"MyEventSource","name":"my-custom-counter","displayName":"my-custom-counter","unit":"ms","counterType":"Metric","tags":"","value":1}
{"timestamp":"2023-11-05T18:52:37.5321623-05:00","provider":"MyEventSource","name":"my-custom-counter","displayName":"my-custom-counter","unit":"ms","counterType":"Metric","tags":"","value":1}
{"timestamp":"2023-11-05T18:52:42.5360839-05:00","provider":"MyEventSource","name":"my-custom-counter","displayName":"my-custom-counter","unit":"ms","counterType":"Metric","tags":"","value":1}
{"timestamp":"2023-11-05T18:52:47.5309596-05:00","provider":"MyEventSource","name":"my-custom-counter","displayName":"my-custom-counter","unit":"ms","counterType":"Metric","tags":"","value":1}
{"timestamp":"2023-11-05T18:52:52.5323712-05:00","provider":"MyEventSource","name":"my-custom-counter","displayName":"my-custom-counter","unit":"ms","counterType":"Metric","tags":"","value":1}
{"timestamp":"2023-11-05T18:52:57.5310386-05:00","provider":"MyEventSource","name":"my-custom-counter","displayName":"my-custom-counter","unit":"ms","counterType":"Metric","tags":"","value":1}
```

## Dump

The [Dump API](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/blob/main/documentation/api/dump.md) captures a managed dump of a specified process without using a debugger. Navigate to `https://localhost:52323/dump?pid={pid}&durationSeconds=60` and wait to get a `.dmp` file (the app is suspended while the dump is being collected). The dump files can be analyzed using tools such as [dotnet-dump](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-dump) or Visual Studio. A dump file cannot be analyzed on a machine of a different OS/Architecture than where it was captured.

## GCDump

The [GCDump API](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/blob/main/documentation/api/gcdump.md) captures a GC dump of a specified process. Navigate to `https://localhost:52323/gcdump?pid={pid}&durationSeconds=60` and wait to get a `.gcdump` file. Apart from Visual Studio, we can use [PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview) to analyze the gcdump file and [dotnet-gcdump](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-gcdump) to generate reports. Unlike a dump file, a gcdump file is a portable format that can be analyzed regardless of the platform it was collected.

We hope that this article serves as an introduction and encourages you to utilize this fantastic tool. All the code is available [here](https://github.com/raulnq/dotnet-monitor). Thanks, and happy coding.
