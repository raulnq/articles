While AWS Lambda offers default metrics for basic monitoring, sometimes we need to look closely at function performance and resource use. Here is where [CloudWatch Lambda Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Lambda-Insights.html) helps, providing enhanced observability designed for our Lambda functions.

## What is CloudWatch Lambda Insights?

Lambda Insights collects, aggregates, and summarizes a new set of metrics for our functions. It does this by using a CloudWatch Lambda Extension (provided as a Lambda layer), which runs alongside our function in the same execution environment. This extension gathers detailed performance data for each invocation and sends it as log events using the [embedded metric format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html) to a dedicated CloudWatch Log Group (`/aws/lambda-insights`). CloudWatch then processes these logs to generate metrics.

## What Metrics Does Lambda Insights Track?

Lambda Insights provides a new set of [metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Lambda-Insights-metrics.html). Key metrics include:

* `duration`: The overall duration of the invocation.
    
* `cpu_total_time`: Total CPU time used by the function.
    
* `memory_utilization`: Maximum memory used as a percentage of allocated memory.
    
* `total_network`: The number of bytes received and sent by the function.
    
* `fd_use`: The maximum number of file descriptors in use.
    
* `init_duration`: The time spent in the `init` phase of the Lambda execution environment lifecycle.
    
* `total_memory`: The amount of memory allocated to our function.
    
* `billed_duration`: Includes the `duration` plus a small amount of time needed to initialize the runtime.
    
* `billed_mb_ms`: The total amount of compute resources used by our function is calculated by multiplying `total_memory` by the `billed_duration`.
    

## Use Cases for Lambda Insights

Enabling Lambda Insights is particularly beneficial in the following scenarios:

* **Cold Start Analysis:** The detailed breakdown of initialization times helps identify and reduce cold start latency.
    
* **Performance Optimization**: Lambda Insights offers detailed memory and CPU usage metrics that help identify resource-related bottlenecks.
    
* **Cost Optimization**: By identifying inefficient resource utilization, Lambda Insights helps optimize function configurations to reduce costs while maintaining performance.
    
* **Anomaly Detection**: Lambda Insights enables easier identification of unexpected behavior patterns, such as memory leaks, excessive CPU utilization, running out of file descriptors, or unusual network activity.
    
* **Troubleshooting Issues**: The detailed metrics make it easier to diagnose issues occurring in our functions.
    

## Lambda Insights vs. Default Lambda Metrics

* The default Lambda metrics are aggregated per minute, while Lambda Insights allows us to see the values for each invocation.
    
* Lambda Insights offers detailed system-level resource usage metrics (CPU, Memory, Network).
    
* The default Lambda metrics are enabled by default, while Lambda Insights needs to be activated for each function.
    
* Lambda Insights is not free. It incurs costs based on the volume of log data ingested into CloudWatch Logs.
    

Let's deploy a simple .NET Lambda function with Lambda Insights enabled using the SAM.

## **Pre-requisites**

* Have an [IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console) with programmatic access.
    
* Install the Amazon Lambda Templates (`dotnet new -i Amazon.Lambda.Templates`)
    
* Install the Amazon Lambda Tools (`dotnet tool install -g` [`Amazon.Lambda.Tools`](http://Amazon.Lambda.Tools))
    
* Install [AWS SAM C](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)[LI.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console)
    

## **The Lambda Function**

Run the following commands to set up our Lambda function:

```powershell
dotnet new lambda.EmptyFunction -n MyLambda -o .
dotnet add src/MyLambda package Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvents
dotnet new sln -n MyApplications
dotnet sln add --in-root src/MyLambda
```

Open the `Program.cs` file and update the content as follows:

```csharp
using Amazon.Lambda.Core;
using Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvents;

// Assembly attribute to enable the Lambda function's JSON input to be converted into a .NET class.
[assembly: LambdaSerializer(typeof(Amazon.Lambda.Serialization.SystemTextJson.DefaultLambdaJsonSerializer))]

namespace MyLambda;

public class Function
{
    public APIGatewayHttpApiV2ProxyResponse FunctionHandler(APIGatewayHttpApiV2ProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext context)
    {
        return new APIGatewayHttpApiV2ProxyResponse
        {
            Body = @"{""Message"":""Hello World""}",
            StatusCode = 200,
            Headers = new Dictionary<string, string> { { "Content-Type", "application/json" } }
        };
    }
}
```

## **AWS SAM template**

At the solution level, create a `template.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Description: >
  SAM

Resources:

  MyFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Timeout: 60
      MemorySize: 512
      Tracing: Active
      Runtime: dotnet8
      Architectures:
        - x86_64    
      Handler: MyLambda::MyLambda.Function::FunctionHandler
      CodeUri: ./src/MyLambda/
      Policies:
        - CloudWatchLambdaInsightsExecutionRolePolicy
      Layers:
        - !Sub arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:580247275435:layer:LambdaInsightsExtension:55
      Events:
        get:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /
            Method: get

Outputs:
  MyApiEndpoint:
    Description: "API endpoint"
    Value: !Sub "https://${ServerlessRestApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod"
```

To add Lambda Insights to our functions, we need to configure two things:

* Add the `CloudWatchLambdaInsightsExecutionRolePolicy` policy. This policy provides the required permissions to send metrics and logs specifically for Lambda Insights.
    
* Add the specific layer with the Lambda Insights extension. You can find all the layers [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Lambda-Insights-extension-versions.html).
    

Run the following commands to deploy the resources to AWS:

```powershell
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

## Final Words

Do not enable Lambda Insights on all functions by default. Enable it only for:

* Critical production functions where deep visibility is essential.
    
* Functions currently undergoing performance tuning or troubleshooting.
    
* During the development and testing phases.
    

Configure an appropriate data retention period for the `/aws/lambda-insights` log group. Storing insights data indefinitely may incur ongoing CloudWatch Logs storage costs. You can find all the code [here](https://github.com/raulnq/cloudwatch-lambda-insights). Thanks, and happy coding.
